# Simula UiB Beamer Template

To get started, clone this repository (or just download a .zip) and create your presentation in the `Main/main.tex` file. See `Submodule/submodule.tex` and `ExampleFigure/ExampleFigure.tex` for examples on how to include separate files into the main document `main.tex`. Because we're using the `standalone` package, all files (except `main.tex`) can be compiled on their own or as part of a larger project without needing any changes.
